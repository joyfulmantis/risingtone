A new way to master Chinese's tones

Chinese is hard to learn, but it shouldn't be! Part of the barrier many people, especially those who come from a language without tones, have with learning Chinese is mastering the pronunciation, and especially the tones. With just 10 min of our tone drills per day, you can go from not being able to differentiate Chinese tones, to being able to hear them clearly.
